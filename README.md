# typescouter

This app is the result of some experimentations in data visualization. I am a designer and father of two kids with Diabetes. I developed this app to believe that good data visualization can improve the glucose control.

This app is a Native iOS for displaying data from a Nightscout website. 

To run directly from your computer, you will need:

Xcode Version 8.1
iOS 10.0 or better
iPhone 6, 6 Plus (Will work on iPads but not specifically optimized for it yet)
Nightscout account

If you prefer, download and install it on your iphone from app store, it is FREE and without any advertise.
